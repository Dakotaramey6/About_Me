                    <p>My name is Dakota Ramey, I am a developer from Ohio! I have been coding on and off for about 4 years. <br>
                         I developed a love for coding when I was working for a rental car agency and wanted a change. <br>
                         Since then I have learned Java, Javascript and alittle Python. Javascript has taken my heart from the moment I started writing it.
